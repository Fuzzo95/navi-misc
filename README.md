=========

This was a large shared Subversion repository used for many small and some large projects from about 2003 through 2011. It is preserved here in Git format as a record of the creative work performed by the authors during this time period, and as a starting point for continuing work on any projects that haven't yet been spun off into their own repository.

Projects of note
----------------

* This repository started out as a home for things related to [http://picogui.org/](PicoGUI), an embedded GUI project I was working on at the time.
* The [CIA.vc](http://cia.vc/) commit tracking web site started life in this repository, before moving out.
* The [Fyre](http://fyre.navi.cx/) art program lives here. The working version is in the "fyre-1.0" branch, whereas trunk includes early work on a rewritten version that we never finished.
* [Metalkit](https://github.com/scanlime/metalkit) originated in this repository, and now lives in its own Git repo.

There's a lot more in here... many esoteric programs for esoteric microcontrollers, half finished ideas, etc. If you like exploring, I hope you'll enjoy exploring almost a decade of things my friends and I built.
